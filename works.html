            <h class="piecename">Prelude Op. 3 No. 2</h>
            <p class="piecedescription">Also known as 'The Bells of Moscow', this piece is the second part of a set of five 'Morceaux de fantaise' pieces.
                This prelude is one of Rachmaninoff's most famous compositions and is so popular such that Rachmaninoff grew
                tired of performing this piece as an encore at his recitals.

            <h class="piecename">Piano Concerto No. 2</h>
            <p class="piecedescription">Dedicated to Nikolai Dahl, this piece signifies Rachmaninoff's recovery from his depression which resulted from
                the disastrous premier of his first symphony. Winning a Glinka Award, this concerto is his most famous concerto.

            <h class="piecename">Prelude Op. 23 No. 5</h>
            <p class="piecedescription">Written for his Opus 23 set of ten preludes, this prelude is structured in ternary ABA form. Beginning with a
                march like Alla marcia section, the B section consists of a lyrical appregiated melody, before returning
                to a recapitulation of the march section. Along with Prelude Op. 3 No. 2, these two preludes are probably
                his most played and recited preludes today.

            <h class="piecename">Piano concerto No. 3</h>
            <p class="piecedescription">Dedicated to Josef Hofmann, this concerto is revered as one of the most difficult piano concertos ever written
                and also considered by Rachmaninoff to be his favourite concerto. Rachmaninoff's first performance is in
                New York City where his only prior practice was on a silent piano en route to the United States from Russia
                due to time constraints. This concerto is structured into three movements, starting in a sonata-allegro form
                before transitioning to a 'theme and variations' ABACA style movement then transitioning without pause to
                the finale.
